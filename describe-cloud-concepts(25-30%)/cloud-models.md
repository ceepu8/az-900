- Public clouds are owned and operated by third-party providers, offering lower costs, near-unlimited scalability, and high reliability.
- Private clouds are exclusively used by one organization, providing more flexibility, control, and scalability compared to on-premises infrastructure.
- Hybrid clouds combine on-premises infrastructure or a private cloud with a public cloud, allowing data and apps to move between the two environments.
- Hybrid cloud platforms offer greater flexibility, more deployment options, security, compliance, and the ability to seamlessly scale up on-premises infrastructure to the public cloud when needed.
- Edge computing brings the power of cloud computing to IoT devices, reducing latency and enabling real-time insights and experiences.
