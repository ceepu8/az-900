- Cloud services operate on a shared responsibility model, with varying security tasks handled by the cloud provider and the user, depending on the type of deployment (SaaS, PaaS, IaaS, on-premises).
- Regardless of deployment type, users retain responsibilities for data, endpoints, accounts, and access management.
- The cloud offers advantages in addressing information security challenges, allowing organizations to shift day-to-day security responsibilities to the cloud provider and reallocate resources.
- Cloud-enabled approach enables the application of cloud-based security capabilities for improved effectiveness and threat detection, as well as the reallocation of security resources and budget to other business priorities.
- The Well-Architected Framework's overview of the security pillar provides strategies to enhance security posture in the cloud.
